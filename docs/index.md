# CS9840: Probabilistic Generative AI

:::warning

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

:::

Course website for CS9840: Probabilistic GenAI, Winter 2026.
Students will learn the _theoretical foundations_ for generative AI.

> From chatbots to image generators, Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping the world. What algorithms and probabilistic principles power this revolution?
> This course introduces the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of GenAI, covering large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, among more mature methods.
> We will also explore applications in AI for Science, such as drug discovery and weather forecasting.

### Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites.
But, Because GenAI is inherently probabilistic, some basic knowledge of the following is necessary.

:::tip

Students who are not comfortable with these concepts are **highly encouraged** to read the [D2L book, Chapter 2](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/index.html) first and foremost.

:::

- **Probability/statistics:**
  - sum, product, and Bayes' rule,
  - probability distributions (Gaussians, Categorical),
  - maximum likelihood.
- **Linear algebra:**
  - vectors and matrices,
  - matrices/vectors products,
  - matrix inversion.
- **Multivariable calculus:**
  - partial derivatives, gradients, Jacobians, & Hessians,
  - multivariable integration.
- **Machine learning:**
  - regression, classification,
  - neural networks,
  - gradient descent,
  - familiarity with deep learning libraries (code examples are in PyTorch).

## Schedule

:::info

- **Lecture:** Tuesdays, 10 AM–12 PM.
- **Tutorial:** Thursdays, 12:30 PM–1:30 PM.
- **Office hour:** Thursdays, 1:30 PM–3:00 PM.

HW must be submitted before the corresponding tutorial.
For example, HW1 must be submitted before Jan 15, 12:30 PM.
