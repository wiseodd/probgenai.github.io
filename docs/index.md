# Western CS9840: Probabilistic Generative AI

:::warning

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

:::

Course website for CS9840: Probabilistic GenAI, Winter 2026.
Students will learn the _theoretical foundations_ for generative AI.

From chatbots to image generators, Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping the world. What algorithms and probabilistic principles power this revolution?
This course introduces the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of GenAI, covering large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, among more mature methods.
We will also explore applications in AI for Science, such as drug discovery and weather forecasting.

### Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites.
But, Because GenAI is inherently probabilistic, some basic knowledge of the following is necessary.

:::tip
Students who are not comfortable with these concepts are **highly encouraged** to read the [D2L book, Chapter 2](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/index.html) first and foremost.
:::

- **Probability/statistics:**
  - sum, product, and Bayes' rule,
  - probability distributions (Gaussians, Categorical),
  - maximum likelihood.
- **Linear algebra:**
  - vectors and matrices,
  - matrices/vectors products.
  - matrix inversion.
- **Multivariable calculus:**
  - partial derivatives & gradients,
  - multivariable integration.
- **Machine learning:**
  - regression, classification,
  - familiarity with deep learning libraries (code examples are in PyTorch).

## Schedule

:::info

- **Lecture:** Tuesdays, 10 AM–12 PM, MC320.
- **Tutorial:** Thursdays, 12:30 PM–1:30 PM, MC320.
